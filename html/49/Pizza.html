    <h2>Pizza</h2>
    <p>
        Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based
        dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high
        temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.
